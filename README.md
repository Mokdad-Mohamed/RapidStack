# RapidStack

RapidStack is a growing collection of .NET libraries designed to streamline and automate common development tasks for .NET developers. The goal is to reduce boilerplate, speed up development, and provide robust, convention-based solutions for everyday problems.

## Overview

RapidStack currently consists of:

- [RapidStack.AutoDI](./RapidStack.AutoDI.md): Automatic dependency injection registration via attributes.
- [RapidStack.AutoEndpoint](./RapidStack.AutoEndpoint.md): Automatic generation of API endpoints from your application services.

More libraries will be added over time!
